into individual microservices, resulting in a 65% reduction in turnaround time.
◦ Utilized Bitbucket(Git) for version control Jenkins for deployment and conducted testing with Swagger.
Tech Stack: Angular, Spring Boot, HeidiSQL Server.

**Research Intern @ IIT Tirupati (_Fall 2021, Summer 2022_)**
◦ Utilized machine learning methods to evaluate similarity of molecular interactions in biological systems.
◦ Engineered a neural network model with PyTorch and CUDA modules to map ligand vectors to respective binding
sites, enhancing understanding of molecular interactions.
◦ Automated data extraction from the National PLIC database by IISc with Beautiful Soup library, streamlining
research processes.

**Undergraduate Teaching Assistant @ Shiv Nadar University (_Aug 2022 - Dec 2022_)**
◦ Developed lab assessments, instituted anti-plagiarism measures for code submissions, and provided assignment
grading and clarification of concepts in lab sessions and lectures for the Object Oriented Programming course.

## Projects

### Booking Cancellation Forecaster (Full Stack Development, Machine Learning)
◦ Developed a web application predicting hotel booking cancellations, aiding management in room allocation. The model
supports six machine learning algorithms. Trained on key features, including booking details, guest information, and history.
◦ Leveraged Flask and React for Backend and Frontend, offering model flexibility and accurate predictions.

###  SEED Labs (Computer Security)
◦ Implemented SEED Labs to gain practical experience in key cybersecurity domains, including Packet Sniffing, Spoofing,
Adversarial attacks on ML, SQL Injection, and Cryptographic Key Encryption using Open SSL.
◦ Conducted comprehensive application security assessments through white box penetration testing methodologies, ensuring a
thorough understanding of vulnerabilities and potential exploits. Leveraged Docker containers on virtual machines to create
dynamic and realistic environments for simulating and assessing security vulnerabilities.

###  SNU ARC (Full Stack Development)
◦ Collaboratively designed and implemented a student-centric portal tailored to Shiv Nadar University(SNU), by working
closely with a team of developers. Provided a range of offerings, including a pay-later wallet, a sports venue reservation
system, and a visitor entry pass system using HTML, PHP, and Ajax queries.

###  Cross-Lingual Question Answering System (NLP, Deep Learning)
◦ Led a multidisciplinary team in developing a question-answering model, catering to non-English speakers by leveraging
multilingual resources.
◦ Applied advanced BERT models to facilitate question translation, data retrieval via ElasticSearch, and answer provision,
advancing accessibility of information across languages.

### Cassava Leaf Disease Classification (Computer Vision, Deep Learning)
◦ Engineered a disease classifier for cassava leaf images by designing a robust classifier, achieving an impressive 88% accuracy
by employing techniques such as dataset augmentation, customized loss functions, and neural network optimization.
◦ Reduced costs associated with disease diagnosis by minimizing the necessity for on-site cassava crop testing
